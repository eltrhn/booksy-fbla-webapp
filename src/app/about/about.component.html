  Code is available at <a href="https://gitlab.com/hdtrhn/fbla-webapp">my GitLab repo</a>.
  <br/>
  Made with ‚ù§ by ***REMOVED*** for <i><a href="http://www.fbla-pbl.org/competitive-event/coding-programming/">Coding & Programming</a></i> as part of FBLA,
  <br/>
  with liberal use of these technologies (without which none of this would have been possible):
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://python.org">Python 3</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://angular.io">Angular 5</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://developers.google.com/books/docs/overview">Google Books' API (for fetching book images)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Including the following libraries:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/channelcat/sanic">Sanic</a> (Python)</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngx-md">ngx-md</a> (Angular)</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/ahopkins/sanic-jwt">Adam Hopkins' Sanic-JWT</a> (Python)</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/magicstack/asyncpg">MagicStack's AsyncPG</a> (Python)</li>
</ul>
<p>And <a href="https://heroku.com">Heroku</a> for hosting, of course.</p>
<p>
  An early draft of my design spec is also viewable in the GitLab repo, right <a href="https://gitlab.com/hdtrhn/fbla-webapp/blob/master/spec/d+ds.md">here</a>. It includes info about how the database and backend works, among other things.
  <br/><i><small>(Note that it's not properly-formatted markdown; I wrote it as monospaced syntax-highlighted text, so please click the "&lt;/&gt;" button in the top bar to view it as such.)</small></i>
  <br/>
  Some things were added after I wrote it, and some things eventually nixed on account of inviability, but it's still quite good as a surface-level run-through to supplement the HELP articles.
